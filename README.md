# What I found interesting...
I chose to read this article because since due to the recent rize of "vibe coding", using LLM models to generate code for a software through natural language. There is a saying that the demand of software engineers is declining severely, and I wanted to check if this is true.

The article confirmed some of my expectations. The article started off by mentioning concerns of current software developers about the "a-ha" moments these models could create. It was interesting that the "tipping point" around December 2025, where AI models like Gemini 3 and Claude's Opus 4.5 became significantly better at handling complex codes. This led me to think how the decline in the demand for these developers might become faster pretty soon. But, changes in the "role" of software engineers towards somewhat architects---where these engieers take care of the structure, design, and reviewing AI-written code---made me rethink about new potentials software engieers possess for the future.
